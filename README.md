### Libraries Used
We have used following Libraries in this project
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- SKLearn

### Files In The Repository
Following is the description of files in repository
- pak_wdi.csv = CSV Data about Indicators of Pakistan from WDI
- Pakistan - World Development Index.ipynb = Notebook containing all pyhton code of project
- README.md = Readme file of the project

## Summary of Results
- Answer 1- We found that Military expenditures of Pakistan have increased very slightly when compared to increased in GDP as they show a very linear behavior.
- Answer 2- From the graph we can conclude that there is not significant relationship between Population and Inflation of Pakistan. This is because the graph is very uneven. If there was a relation between these two, then the graph should have shown relatively linear behavior
- Answer - 3: From the graph we can conclude Expenditures of Pakistan's Government have been greater than GDP of Pakistan for most of the time. Hence, we can conclude that Pakistan have always mismanaged its Budget.
- Model: When tested our model to predict GDPs of Pakistan over last years against real GDPs, we were able to get predictions shown in notebook execution.

- We have seen that data science helps us a lot to easily conclude results based on historical data and make predictions for future. Although this model may still be improved for better predictions, it still helps a lot to make better calculated predictions.
